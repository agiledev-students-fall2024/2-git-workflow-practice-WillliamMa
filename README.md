[Why Software Application Development Should Be ‘Fun’](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2022/10/25/why-software-application-development-should-be-fun/)

## What I Find Interesting
I think the article emphasis the fun of software development in an interesting perspective, Developer Experience (DX). As the article highlights, when developers enjoy what they do, it fosters innovation, creativity, and efficiency. Kris Jenkins's point about tools enabling a "fast start cadence" resonates strongly, as it underscores the significance of intuitive and flexible development environments that encourage problem-solving without unnecessary friction. Also, it mentions the concept of "shift-left", which emphasizes that while enhancing security and compliance early in the development process is crucial, doing it improperly can stifle creativity and joy. 

Rishi:
I agree that software developement can be fun at times, however if one cannot find a balance between work and life, that would make software developement feel a lot more exhausting.
